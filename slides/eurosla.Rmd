multilingual Word representations are thought to exist in a shared space and are all always active.

(pitcure of words in a shared space in three languages)

---

When we produce words in a language, translation equivalents competitors active and must be inhibited in production.

Example of non-cognate 

---

Cognate words, however, share semantic and orthographic overlap and have been shown be processed more easily

Example of a cognate

# The development of the Cognate Facilitation Effect

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
Not much is known about the trajectory of the CFE in L2 or L3.

It is unclear whether the reaction times of cognates **decrease with as proficiency increases**, and if/when it plateaus (is acquired).

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The **presence or absence** of the CFE in L3 speakers could inform L3 models</h1> <!-- Centered h1 text -->

How?

- Wholesale transfer would predict that L3 learners transfer and have access to **just one language**. 

- If there's no CFE, it might be evidence of wholesale transfer

# The Cognate Facilitation Effect as access to a language-specific lexicon

If there are differences in facilitation effects between two-way and three-way cognates, it could suggest **inhibition of a specific lexicon**. 

 
Example: The L2 and L3 speakers speak the same languages, but only the L2 group shows an effect of cognate.

# Research Questions and hypotheses

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
.red[RQ1]: **Within-L3 speakers**: Will L3 Spanish speakers show cognate facilitation, and will this be stronger for three-way vs two-way cognates? 

.red[RQ2]: **Comparing L2 and L3 speakers**: Will L3 Spanish speakers show a stronger cognate facilitation effect for three-way cognates when compared to L2 learners?

.red[RQ3]: **The role of proficiency**: How will cognate facilitation change as a function of proficiency in both groups? 
]
]
--

.pull-right[
.content-box-blue[
.blue[H1]: As in previous work, we predict that the **CFE will be greater for three-way cognates** in the L3 Spanish group and that the two-way and three-way cognates similar be the same for the L2 group. 

.blue[H2]: We predict that the L3 Spanish speakers and L2 Spanish speakers **differ for three-way cognates, but not two-way cognates**.

.blue[H3]: As **proficiency increases** in both groups, it is predicted that the **CFE increases** in a linear fashion.

**Data trimming**

`r nrow(pf)` total tokens were collected and `r nrow(df_after_outliers %>% filter(!word %in% remove$word)) ` were used in the final analysis.

Summary of removed tokens:

`r incorrect_tokens` incorrect Tokens (accuracy rate = `r round(sum(pf$is_correct)/nrow(pf), digits = 2)*100`%). 

`r tokens_over_3` tokens > 3 seconds.

`r ind_outliers` tokens +/- 2 standard deviations from an individual's overall mean.

`r removed_low_corr_rate` overall word correctness rate of less than 25%.

**Data analysis**

Bayesian Models:

L3 within-subjects analysis: `log reaction time ~ word type + (1 | word) + (word type | participant)`

L2-L3 between-subjects analysis: `log reaction time ~ group:word type + (1 | word) + (word type | participant)`

Analysis of proficiency: `facilitation effect ~ percentage of correct answers:cognate_type:group`

# Key take-aways 

- L2 learners showed only descriptive evidence of a CFE

- L3 learners showed similar effects for both two and three-way cognates

- The role of language proficiency the CFE may be non-linear, and follow u-shaped curve 

- A null CFE makes sense if there is a full spectrum of proficiency

- GAMMs are a good option to analyze this non-linear relationship
