- Most work is in offline studies, little knowledge of Ln processing.

- The present work focuses on the processing of **cognates** by multilinguals.

- Lexical transfer may also transfer syntactic frames (Ecke & Hall, 2014).

# Research Questions and hypotheses

.red[Research Question]: **Within-L3 speakers**, will cognate words be processed faster than non-cognate words, and triple cognates faster than double cognates? 
]
]

.pull-right[
.content-box-blue[
.blue[Hypothesis]: As in previous work, we predict that the **reaction times** in correct trials will be lowest for three-way cognates, followed by two-way cognates, and then non-cognates.

# Stimuli 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
- Stimuli were chosen by carrying out an analysis of the PHOR-in-one data base (Costa et al., 2023)

- Stimuli were matched for word length and lexical frequency.

- Cognates with 100% orthographic overlap were chosen.

- Psuedowords were generated in Unipsuedo (New et al., 2024).

**Examples:**

- *Three-way cognate*: horror, horror, Horror 
- *Two-way cognate*: piano, piano, Klavier 
- *Non-cognate*: face, rostro, Gesicht

# Data analysis

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
**Data trimming**

`r nrow(pf)` total tokens were collected and `r nrow(df_after_outliers %>% filter(!word %in% remove$word)) ` were used in the final analysis.

Some tokens had to be removed for the following reasons:

**Incorrect**: `r incorrect_tokens`  (accuracy rate = `r round(sum(pf$is_correct)/nrow(pf), digits = 2)*100`%). 

**Longer than 3 seconds**: `r tokens_over_3`.

**+/- 2 SD from an individual's mean**:`r ind_outliers`.

**Words that 75%+ participants got incorrect**: `r removed_low_corr_rate`.

# Discussion 

.pull.left[
.content-box-blue[
- The effect of double and triple cognates was similar in L3 Spanish speakers: this would suggest that their **L1 German did not benefit them in processing** (all stimuli were at least Spanish-English cognates).

- The **experimental setting** could have played a role (language modes): these students only hear their instructor speak Spanish with occasional switches to English and took the experiment in a classroom setting.

- We plan to **add an L1 English - L2 Spanish group** to determine whether the results have to do with some unknown confounding aspect of the stimulus list.
]]

# Discussion 

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
- An analysis of the random effects also showed that not every participant showed evidence of the effects.

- The results might also be a result of **biased estimates** of the group model due to shrinkage of partially pooled random effect estimates.

# Simulation

.pull-left[
.content-box-blue[
**Details**

Data sets were simulated using measures of variation and the number of items from the collected data.

10 participants were simulated in which:

- 4 had a true medium effect

- 3 had a true small effect 

- 3 had a true null effect

A mixed effects model was fit to each simulated data set.

.pull-right[

**The goal was to determine:**

How many models would show a **significant cognate effect** at the **group level**, when it's really only true for 70% of participants?

What was the average (or distribution of) change to the effect of true-null participants as compared to the medium and small effect participants?

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Closer evaluations of individuals may be warranted in the cases in which we expect individual variation in the **direction of an effect**</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">**More data per individual** or novel analyses can help to uncover how L3 learners show variation in the **size and direction** of effects</h1>
